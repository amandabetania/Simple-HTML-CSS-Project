# 🌐 Web Development Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of **simple web development projects** created as part of my daily and consistent practice routine. The projects focus on building a strong foundation in front-end development using **HTML and CSS**.

Each project represents hands-on practice of layout, styling, and basic UI ideas, and the repository will continue to grow as I add new exercises.
